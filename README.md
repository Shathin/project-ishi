# Project Ishi

## About

Project Ishi is an application for doctors to help track different patient related information like patient name, age, gender, etc. and procedure related information like procedure name, code, cost (billed and paid amount), etc.

Project Ishi aims to provide a beautiful and easy to use interface to perform the above mentioned task.

Each user of the application can define the schema for their patient-procedure records. Initally a base schema is provided to each new user with some fields being unremovable; the users can then build upon this schema to suit their needs. Each field will go under the patient related information or procedure related information.

Furthermore, the user can generate a summary of the records that they've recorded using the application.
